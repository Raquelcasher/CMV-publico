00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.606
Once upon a time, the storytellers

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Fantastic beings, whose mission was to discover magical places

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.074
And tell the rest of the world

4
00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.074
Suddenly the unexpected happened

5
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.074
One of the last storytellers, opened a hope

6
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.774
From the high seas he sensed beaches


7
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.774
And he entered gorges of great beauty,
for the wild and intact environment that surrounds them

8
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.074
and ran and jumped and climbed


9
00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.000
Until knowing the protector of that land

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.174
as if it were the perfect guardian


11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.074
this guided him through an adventure of silence


12
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.074
and majesty

13
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.074
"We will witness our journey and we will witness his greatness," he said.

14
00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.074
the storyteller furrowed the interior of that world

15
00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:05.074
admiring a formidable spectacle of ravines

16
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:10.074
marked by tongues of fire of dragons, today asleep
 

17
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:13.000
A magical place, where time stands still


18
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.074
In which the tail appears, of the mythical dragon


19
00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:29.074
He told everyone that he had discovered a place where "it seems that you touch the sky with your hands while keeping your feet on the ground"


20
00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.074
In which you feel THE KING OF THE WORLD

21
00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.700
He warned, disapproval, of what one day was an island of splendid greenery

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.074
That fantasy land captivated him


23
00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.074
He heard the silence broken by the murmur of the sea


24
00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.074
The roar of unbeatable underwater creatures, spitting water
 

25
00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.074
The storyteller described that world turning completely blue, for 1 hour

26
00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.074
and there he discovered that you can walk on water


27
00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.074
That if you want, you can swim on the sand


28
00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.074
That dreams inhabit a huge desert and end up in the sea


29
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.074
Come 

30
00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.074
That there is not a single day, in which the landscape is the same


31
00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.074
Come

32
00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.074
To this fairytale island!
